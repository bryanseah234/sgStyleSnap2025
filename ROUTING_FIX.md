# Routing Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Problem
After deploying to Vercel, routes like `/closet` were not working when accessed directly. This is a common issue with Single Page Applications (SPAs) where:
1. Client-side routes aren't recognized by the server
2. Authentication state wasn't initialized before routing decisions were made

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `vercel.json` in Root Directory
- **Location**: Root directory (was only in `deployment/` folder)
- **Purpose**: Configures Vercel to serve `index.html` for all routes
- **Features Added**:
  - Rewrites all routes to `/index.html` for SPA routing
  - Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)
  - Asset caching for performance

### 2. Fixed Auth Initialization in `src/main.js`
- **Problem**: App was mounting before auth state was loaded
- **Solution**: Initialize auth before mounting the app
- **Changes**:
  - Setup auth state listener
  - Call `initializeAuth()` before `app.mount()`
  - App only mounts after auth is ready

### 3. Enhanced Router Guards in `src/router.js`
- **Problem**: Router was checking auth before it was initialized
- **Solution**: Wait for auth loading to complete
- **Changes**:
  - Made `beforeEach` guard async
  - Added waiting logic for auth initialization (max 5 seconds)
  - Added debug logging for route navigation

### 4. Fixed App.vue Component
- **Problem**: Duplicate auth initialization and wrong property name
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate initialization, fixed watcher
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `initializeAuth()` call (now in main.js)
  - Changed `isLoggedIn` to `isAuthenticated`
  - Added `immediate: true` to watcher

## How It Works Now

### On Initial Page Load:
1. Vite/Vercel serves `index.html` for any route
2. Vue app created with Pinia and Router
3. Auth state initialized and listener setup
4. App waits for auth initialization to complete
5. App mounts to DOM
6. Router navigates to requested route
7. Router guard checks auth (now ready)
8. User sees correct page

### On Navigation:
1. User clicks link or enters URL
2. Router guard intercepts navigation
3. Guard waits if auth still loading
4. Guard checks authentication
5. Protected routes redirect to login if not authenticated
6. Guest routes redirect to closet if authenticated

## Testing

After deploying these changes:
1. Navigate directly to `/closet` - should work if logged in
2. Refresh page while on any route - should stay on same route
3. Try accessing protected routes while logged out - should redirect to login
4. Try accessing login while logged in - should redirect to closet

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Vercel:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Any other required variables from your `.env`

## OAuth Configuration

Ensure your Supabase OAuth redirect URLs include:
- `https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app/closet`
- `https://your-custom-domain.com/closet` (if using custom domain)

## Next Steps

1. Commit these changes
2. Push to your repository
3. Vercel will auto-deploy
4. Test all routes after deployment
5. Check browser console for any errors

## Files Modified

- ✅ `vercel.json` (created in root)
- ✅ `src/main.js` (auth initialization)
- ✅ `src/router.js` (async guards with waiting)
- ✅ `src/App.vue` (removed duplicate init, fixed watcher)
