# GitHub Workflows - Sync Summary

## ✅ Updated Workflows

### 1. **node.js.yml** → **StyleSnap CI**
**Changes Made:**
- ❌ Removed Node.js 22.x (not LTS yet, causes instability)
- ✅ Using only LTS versions: 18.x and 20.x
- ✅ Added proper build step with Vite (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Added linting step (continues on error if not configured)
- ✅ Added build artifact upload (dist folder)
- ✅ Set proper NODE_ENV for production builds
- ✅ Renamed to "StyleSnap CI" for clarity

**What it does:**
- Runs on every push/PR to main branch
- Tests on Node 18 and Node 20
- Installs dependencies → Lints → Builds with Vite → Runs tests
- Uploads build artifacts for inspection

---

### 2. **greetings.yml** → **Updated Messages**
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Added StyleSnap-specific welcome messages
- ✅ References project documentation (PROJECT_CONTEXT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, etc.)
- ✅ Points to CODE_STANDARDS.md for contributors
- ✅ Includes helpful checklist for issues and PRs

**What it does:**
- Welcomes first-time contributors
- Provides guidance on how to contribute properly
- References your comprehensive documentation structure

---

### 3. **manual.yml** → **Manual Operations**
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Converted from "hello world" example to useful operations menu
- ✅ Added operation choices:
  - `build-only` - Just build with Vite
  - `test-only` - Just run tests
  - `full-ci` - Lint + Build + Test
  - `purge-old-items` - Run maintenance script (dry run)
  - `cloudinary-cleanup` - Clean orphaned images (dry run)
- ✅ Added environment selection (staging/production)
- ✅ All operations are safe (maintenance scripts run in dry-run mode)

**What it does:**
- Allows manual triggering from GitHub Actions UI
- Useful for one-off builds, tests, or maintenance tasks
- Safe by default (maintenance scripts preview changes only)

## ✅ Workflows That Didn't Need Changes

### 4. **supabase-keepalive.yml** ✅
**Status:** Already correct!
- Uses Node.js 18
- Properly configured for Supabase keep-alive
- Runs every 5 days to prevent project pause

### 5. **label.yml** ✅
**Status:** Already correct!
- Standard PR labeler workflow
- No dependencies on your tech stack
- Works as-is

### 6. **summary.yml** ✅
**Status:** Already correct!
- AI-powered issue summarization
- No dependencies on your tech stack
- Works as-is

## 🎯 Your Tech Stack (For Reference)

✅ **Framework:** Vue.js 3
✅ **Build Tool:** Vite
✅ **Runtime:** Node.js (LTS: 18.x, 20.x)
✅ **Package Manager:** npm
✅ **Testing:** Vitest (unit) + Playwright (e2e)
✅ **Linting:** ESLint + Prettier

❌ **NOT using:**
- Webpack (using Vite instead)
- Next.js (that's React, you're using Vue)
- Grunt (old task runner, not needed)
- Deno (different runtime)

## 🚀 How to Use Your Workflows

### Automatic CI (node.js.yml / StyleSnap CI)
Runs automatically on:
- Every push to `main`
- Every pull request to `main`

### Manual Operations (manual.yml)
1. Go to GitHub → Actions tab
2. Select "Manual Operations" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose operation and environment
5. Click green "Run workflow" button

### Maintenance Scripts
From the manual workflow, you can run:
- `purge-old-items` - Preview items older than 2 years
- `cloudinary-cleanup` - Preview orphaned images

**Note:** These run in `--dry-run` mode by default (safe preview only)

To run for real:
```bash
# On your local machine or server
npm run purge-old-items
npm run cloudinary-cleanup
```

## 📋 Next Steps (Optional)

### Add a Deployment Workflow
If you deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or similar, create:
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

Example for Vercel:
```yaml
name: Deploy to Vercel

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20.x'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v25
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
```

### Add E2E Testing Workflow
If you want to run Playwright tests in CI:
`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`

```yaml
name: E2E Tests

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20.x'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - run: npm run test:e2e
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: failure()
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```
