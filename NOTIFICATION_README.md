# 🔔 Notification System - Complete Implementation

## Overview

A comprehensive, real-time notification system for StyleSnap that enables friend interactions including outfit suggestions, likes on outfits, and likes on individual closet items.

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

All visual components, backend services, database schema, and integrations have been implemented and are ready for testing.

## 🎯 Features

### 1. **Friend Outfit Suggestions**
Friends can manually create outfit suggestions using items from your virtual closet. You receive a notification and can approve/reject the suggestion. Upon approval, the outfit is automatically added to your closet.

**Flow:**
```
Friend → Browse your closet → Select items → Add message → Submit
   ↓
You → Receive notification → View suggestion → Approve/Reject
   ↓
Approved → Outfit added to "My Outfits" automatically
```

### 2. **Outfit Likes**
Friends can like your shared outfits. You receive a notification each time a friend likes one of your outfits.

### 3. **Item Likes**
Friends can like individual items in your closet. Each like generates a notification, and the total like count is displayed on the item.

### 4. **Real-time Updates**
All notifications appear instantly using Supabase real-time subscriptions. No page refresh needed.

### 5. **Notification Badge**
The navigation bar displays a bell icon with a red badge showing the unread notification count. The badge pulses when new notifications arrive.

### 6. **Browser Notifications** (Optional)
Desktop notifications can be enabled for instant alerts even when the app isn't active.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

The `date-fns` library has already been installed for date formatting.

### 2. Database Setup

Run the SQL migration in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `sql/009_notifications_system.sql`
3. Execute the query

This creates:
- 3 new tables (notifications, friend_outfit_suggestions, item_likes)
- 4 triggers for auto-notification creation
- 6 RPC functions for operations
- Complete RLS policies for security

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test the System

Open the app and:
- Log in as two different users (who are friends)
- Have one user like the other's item
- Watch the notification appear in real-time!

## 🎨 UI Components

### NotificationBadge
A small red badge showing unread count (max "99+").

**Usage:**
```vue
<NotificationBadge 
  :count="unreadCount" 
  :pulse="hasNewNotification" 
/>
```

### NotificationItem
Individual notification card with avatar, message, timestamp, and type-specific icons.

**Features:**
- Unread indicator (blue dot)
- Different styling for unread notifications
- Click to navigate to relevant content
- Hover effects

### NotificationsList
Main container with "All" and "Unread" tabs.

**Features:**
- Tab filtering
- Pagination with "Load More"
- Empty states
- Loading states

### SuggestionApprovalCard
Modal for approving/rejecting outfit suggestions.

**Features:**
- Grid display of suggested items
- Suggester's message display
- Approve/Reject buttons
- Loading states during processing

### ItemLikeButton
Heart button for liking closet items.

**Features:**
- Filled/outline states
- Like count display
- Click to see who liked
- Smooth animations

## 🔐 Security

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS enabled with policies:

✅ Users can only view their own notifications
✅ Only friends can like items/outfits  
✅ Only friends can create suggestions
✅ Cannot like your own items
✅ Cannot suggest outfits to yourself

### Friendship Validation
All triggers verify friendship status before creating notifications.

### Ownership Checks
RPC functions verify ownership before allowing approve/reject operations.

## ⚡ Performance

### Real-time Subscriptions
- WebSocket connection (no polling)
- Filtered at database level (only your notifications)
- Auto-reconnect on disconnect

### Pagination
- 20 notifications per page
- Efficient LIMIT/OFFSET queries
- "Load More" for infinite scroll

### Denormalized Counts
- `clothes.likes_count` updated via trigger
- `shared_outfits.likes_count` updated via trigger
- No COUNT() queries on every fetch

### Indexes
- All foreign keys indexed
- Composite indexes on frequently queried columns
- created_at DESC for chronological sorting

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
Follow the checklist in `NOTIFICATION_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` for 20+ comprehensive tests.

### Key Tests
1. ✅ Real-time notification delivery
2. ✅ Badge count updates
3. ✅ Approval workflow (approve/reject)
4. ✅ Like functionality (items + outfits)
5. ✅ Mark as read functionality
6. ✅ Pagination
7. ✅ RLS policy enforcement
8. ✅ Mobile responsiveness

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check notifications table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notifications;

-- Check triggers exist
SELECT trigger_name FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name LIKE '%notify%';

-- Check RPC functions
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name LIKE '%notification%';
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Using Notification Store
```vue
<script setup>
import { useNotificationsStore } from './stores/notifications-store'

const notificationsStore = useNotificationsStore()

// Access state
const unreadCount = notificationsStore.unreadCount
const hasUnread = notificationsStore.hasUnread

// Mark as read
await notificationsStore.markAsRead(notificationId)

// Mark all as read
await notificationsStore.markAllAsRead()

// Refresh
await notificationsStore.refresh()
</script>
```

### Using Services Directly
```javascript
import { notificationsService } from './services/notifications-service'
import { friendSuggestionsService } from './services/friend-suggestions-service'
import { likesService } from './services/likes-service'

// Get notifications
const notifications = await notificationsService.getNotifications({ 
  limit: 20, 
  offset: 0 
})

// Create suggestion
await friendSuggestionsService.createSuggestion({
  friendId: 'uuid',
  outfitItems: [{ id: '...', name: '...', image_url: '...' }],
  message: 'This would look great on you!'
})

// Like an item
await likesService.likeClosetItem(itemId)
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Optional Enhancements
1. **Email Notifications** - Send email for important notifications
2. **Web Push API** - Implement push notifications for mobile
3. **Notification Settings** - Let users customize notification preferences
4. **Sound Customization** - Let users choose notification sound
5. **Rich Previews** - Add image thumbnails to notifications
6. **Notification Categories** - Add more notification types

### Integration with Existing Features
The notification system is already integrated with:
- ✅ Friends system
- ✅ Closet (clothes table)
- ✅ Outfits (generated_outfits, shared_outfits)
- ✅ Authentication (auth-store)
- ✅ Navigation (MainLayout)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Notifications not appearing?**
- Verify database migration ran successfully
- Check users are authenticated and friends
- Check Supabase real-time is enabled

**Badge showing wrong count?**
- Ensure `notificationsStore.initialize()` is called in MainLayout
- Check `is_read` values in database

**Approval not working?**
- Verify `approve_friend_outfit_suggestion()` function exists
- Check suggestion status is 'pending'
- Verify outfit_items array has valid data

See [NOTIFICATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md](./NOTIFICATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed troubleshooting.
