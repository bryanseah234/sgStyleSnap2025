## 🔧 Testing Approach

### Mocking Strategy
All tests use proper mocking to avoid external dependencies:
- **Supabase client:** Mocked using `vi.mock()`
- **Auth service:** Mocked authentication checks
- **Database operations:** Mocked query responses
- **Consistent patterns:** All mocks follow the same structure

### First Run Results
```
Test Files:  11 total
Tests:       125 total (81 passed, 44 failed)
Pass Rate:   65%
