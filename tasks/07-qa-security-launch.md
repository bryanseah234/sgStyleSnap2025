- Friends can view friends-only items
- Public items visible to authenticated users
- Quota enforcement at database level

**Friends Table:**
- Users can view own friendships
- Users can send/accept/reject requests
- Canonical ordering prevents duplicates
- Users can delete own friendships

**Suggestions Table:**
- Users can view received/sent suggestions
- Users can create suggestions
- Recipients can mark as read
- Creators can delete suggestions

### Input Validation

**Search Queries:**

- Maximum 10 results
- Randomized order

**Messages:**
- Maximum 100 characters
- Trimmed whitespace

**File Uploads:**
- Type validation (jpg, png, webp)
- Size limit (5 MB)
- Cloudinary transformation applied

**Quota Enforcement:**
- 50 upload limit per user
- Catalog items unlimited
- Database constraint enforced
- Application-level checks

### Error Handling

**Comprehensive Error Logging:**
- All async operations in try-catch
- console.error with context
