## Implementation Details:

### quota-calculator.js (✅ Complete)

**Functions:**
- `calculateQuota(currentCount, maxCount = 50)` - Calculates quota metrics
  - Returns: used, max, remaining, percentage, isNearLimit, isFull
- `canAddItems(currentCount, itemsToAdd = 1, maxCount = 50)` - Checks if items can be added
  - Returns: { allowed: boolean, reason?: string }
- `getQuotaColor(percentage)` - Returns color based on usage
  - 0-79%: 'success', 80-89%: 'warning', 90-100%: 'danger'
- `getQuotaMessage(quota)` - Returns user-friendly message
  - Normal: "You have X items. Y spots remaining."
  - Near limit: "You're almost at your limit! Only Y spots left."
  - Full: "You've reached your 50 upload limit. Add unlimited items from catalog!"

### ProgressBar.vue (✅ Complete)

**Props:**
- `value` (Number, required) - Current progress value
