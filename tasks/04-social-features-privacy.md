### UI Components Status:
- **Implemented**: Friends.vue (structure), Profile.vue (full implementation)
- **Stub/Placeholder**: FriendsList.vue, FriendProfile.vue, FriendRequest.vue
- **Note**: UI components are stubs but backend services are fully functional and tested

## 4.1 Friend Management System
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Implement POST /users/search endpoint with anti-scraping measures
  - [x] Minimum 3-character query requirement (searchUsers function validates)
  - [x] Rate limiting: 20 searches per minute (enforced at API level)
  - [x] Result limit: 10 users maximum (.limit(10) in query)
  - [x] Random ordering (no pagination) (.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5))
  - [x] Never return email addresses (excluded from results object)
  - [x] Search by username (fuzzy) or email (exact match only) (.or() query)
  - [x] Include friendship status in results (none, pending_sent, pending_received, accepted)
- [x] Implement POST /friends/request endpoint (by user_id, not email) (sendFriendRequest function)
- [x] Implement POST /friends/:id/accept endpoint (acceptFriendRequest function)
- [x] Implement POST /friends/:id/reject endpoint (rejectFriendRequest function)
- [ ] Build secure friend search UI with debouncing (FriendsList.vue is stub)
- [ ] Create pending requests notification system (FriendRequest.vue is stub)

## 4.2 Privacy-Critical Features
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Implement GET /friends/:id/cabinet endpoint (getFriendProfile function)
  - [x] Enforce privacy='friends' filter (.eq('privacy', 'friends'))
  - [x] Verify accepted friendship status (checks friendship.status === 'accepted')
  - [x] Never expose private items (only returns items with privacy='friends')
  - [x] Add comprehensive test cases (54 tests in friends-integration.test.js)
- [x] Build privacy toggle in item creation/edit (implemented in closet forms)
- [x] Display privacy indicators in UI (privacy badges in ItemDetailModal.vue)

## 4.3 Friends UI Components
- [x] Build `Friends.vue` page component (structure with PopularItemsCarousel)
- [ ] Create `FriendsList.vue` component (stub - needs full implementation)
  - [ ] Accepted friends section
  - [ ] Pending requests section
  - [ ] Search bar for adding friends
- [ ] Build `FriendProfile.vue` component (stub - needs full implementation)
  - [ ] Display friend's shareable closet
  - [ ] "Create Suggestion" button
- [ ] Implement friend request notifications (NotificationBell.vue exists)

## 4.4 Profile Management
- [x] Build `Profile.vue` page component (full implementation with tabs)
- [x] Create user profile update functionality (profile display with user info)
- [x] Implement theme toggle (light/dark mode) (dark mode CSS included)
- [x] Add sign out button with confirmation (handleLogout with confirm dialog)

pages/
Friends.vue
Profile.vue
components/
social/
FriendsList.vue
FriendProfile.vue

stores/

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [x] Users can search for friends by username or email (secure) (searchUsers function implemented)
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Search prevents database scraping:
  - [x] Minimum 3-character queries enforced (validated in searchUsers)
  - [x] Rate limiting active (20/minute) (enforced at API level)
  - [x] Results limited to 10 users (.limit(10) query)
  - [x] No pagination or result counts (has_more always false)
  - [x] Random ordering on each search (.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5))
  - [x] Email addresses never exposed (excluded from results)
- [x] Friend requests can be sent and accepted (sendFriendRequest, acceptFriendRequest functions)
- [x] Privacy settings are strictly enforced (RLS policies + application-level checks)
- [x] Friend's closets only show 'friends' privacy items (getFriendProfile filters by privacy='friends')
- [x] Profile page displays user info and settings (Profile.vue with tabs, user details, logout)
- [ ] Monitoring alerts on suspicious search patterns (requires backend monitoring setup)

### Implementation Highlights:

**Anti-Scraping Measures**:
- 3-character minimum query length enforced
- Hard limit of 10 results per search
- Random result ordering (no pagination)
- Email addresses never returned in search results
- has_more always false to prevent enumeration

**Privacy Enforcement**:
- Canonical friendship ordering (requester_id < receiver_id)
- Prevents duplicate friendship records
- Friend profile access requires accepted friendship
- Only shows items with privacy='friends'
- Returns 404 for both non-friends and non-existent users (security)

**Friendship States**:
- `none`: No relationship
- `pending_sent`: Current user sent request
- `pending_received`: Current user received request
- `accepted`: Active friendship

**Security Features**:
- No email enumeration (returns success even for non-existent users)
- Prevents self-friend requests
- Verifies friendship before exposing data
- RLS policies enforced at database level
- Application-level checks for double security
