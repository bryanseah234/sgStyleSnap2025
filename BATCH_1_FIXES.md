# BATCH 1: DATABASE SCHEMA FIXES - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Fixed 10 critical and medium issues in the database schema files.

---

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue #1: Missing `auth.uid()` function integration
**File:** `sql/001_initial_schema.sql`
**Status:** FIXED
**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive authentication integration documentation
- Clarified how Supabase Auth integrates with users table
- Documented that users.id should match auth.users.id
- Explained how RLS policies use auth.uid()

---

### ✅ Issue #2: No `updated_at` trigger
**File:** `sql/001_initial_schema.sql`
**Status:** FIXED
**Changes:**
- Added `update_updated_at_column()` trigger function
- Applied trigger to all tables: users, clothes, friends, suggestions
- Automatically updates `updated_at` timestamp on row modifications

---

### ✅ Issue #3: `friends` table bidirectionality issue
**File:** `sql/001_initial_schema.sql`
**Status:** FIXED
**Changes:**
- Added CHECK constraint: `CHECK (requester_id < receiver_id)`
- Enforces canonical ordering to prevent duplicate friendships
- Prevents User A → User B AND User B → User A scenarios

---

### ✅ Issue #4: Missing indexes on foreign keys
**File:** `sql/003_indexes_functions.sql`
**Status:** FIXED
**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive indexing strategy
- Added indexes for all foreign key columns
- Added composite indexes for common query patterns
- Added partial indexes with WHERE clauses for performance

**New Indexes:**
- `idx_clothes_category` - For filtering by category
- `idx_suggestions_from_user_id` - For querying sent suggestions
- `idx_suggestions_created_at` - For ordering recent suggestions
- `idx_suggestions_is_read` - For unread suggestions queries
- `idx_users_email` - For email lookups (excludes soft-deleted)
- `idx_users_google_id` - For OAuth lookups (excludes soft-deleted)

---

### ✅ Issue #5: `provider_id` naming confusion
**File:** `sql/001_initial_schema.sql`
**Status:** FIXED
**Changes:**
- Renamed `provider_id` to `google_id`
- Added comment: "OAuth provider ID from Google"
- Made field nullable (was NOT NULL, now optional)
- Clearer intent for OAuth integration

---

### ✅ Issue #6: No soft delete for `users`
**File:** `sql/001_initial_schema.sql`
**Status:** FIXED
**Changes:**
- Added `removed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` to users table
- Consistent soft delete pattern across all tables
- Enables user account deletion with recovery period

---

### ✅ Issue #7 & #50: `suggestions.message` has no length constraint
**File:** `sql/001_initial_schema.sql`
**Status:** FIXED
**Changes:**
- Added CHECK constraint: `CHECK (char_length(message) <= 100)`
- Matches API specification (100 chars max)
- Database now enforces what API documents

**Additional Constraints Added:**
- `CONSTRAINT check_item_ids_not_empty` - Ensures at least 1 item in suggestion
- `CONSTRAINT check_max_items` - Limits to 10 items per suggestion

---

### ✅ Issue #8: Missing `thumbnail_url` generation logic
**File:** `sql/001_initial_schema.sql`
**Status:** DOCUMENTED
**Changes:**
- Added documentation comment to clothes table
- Clarified that `image_url` is full resolution (max 1080px)
- Clarified that `thumbnail_url` is auto-generated by Cloudinary
- Example: `c_thumb,w_300,h_300` transformation

---

### ✅ Issue #9: No `viewed_at` timestamp for suggestions
**File:** `sql/001_initial_schema.sql`
**Status:** FIXED
**Changes:**
- Added `viewed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` column
- Tracks when suggestion was actually read
- Complements `is_read` boolean with timestamp

---

### ✅ Issue #10: `likes` table present but marked future
**File:** `sql/001_initial_schema.sql`
**Status:** FIXED
**Changes:**
- Commented out entire `likes` table
- Added note: "MOVED TO FUTURE MIGRATION: This table is not part of MVP"
- Prevents confusion about MVP scope
- Can be uncommented when implementing likes feature

---

### ✅ Issue #17: `check_item_quota()` doesn't enforce the limit
**File:** `sql/003_indexes_functions.sql`
**Status:** DOCUMENTED
**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive documentation to function
- Clarified that function only COUNTS items
- Documented that API must enforce 200-item limit
- Added usage example and expected API behavior
- Changed return type to explicit INTEGER
- Added STABLE keyword for query optimization

---

### ✅ Issue #19: No cleanup function for soft-deleted items
**File:** `sql/003_indexes_functions.sql`
**Status:** FIXED
**Changes:**
- Created `cleanup_old_removed_items()` function
- Permanently deletes items soft-deleted 30+ days ago
- Returns count of deleted items
- Includes RAISE NOTICE for logging
- Should be run as scheduled job (daily via pg_cron or external cron)

**Function:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cleanup_old_removed_items()
RETURNS INTEGER AS $$
DECLARE
    deleted_count INTEGER;
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM clothes
    WHERE removed_at IS NOT NULL
    AND removed_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
    
    GET DIAGNOSTICS deleted_count = ROW_COUNT;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Permanently deleted % items', deleted_count;
    RETURN deleted_count;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### ✅ Issue #16: `get_friend_closet()` function security issue
**File:** `sql/003_indexes_functions.sql`
**Status:** FIXED
**Changes:**
- Changed return type from `SETOF clothes` to explicit `TABLE()`
- Only returns necessary fields (excludes `owner_id`, `removed_at`, `privacy`, `updated_at`)
- Added `SECURITY INVOKER` to respect RLS policies
- Added `STABLE` keyword for query optimization
- Improved query logic for clarity

**Security Improvements:**
- Function no longer returns sensitive fields
- RLS policies still apply (SECURITY INVOKER)
- Reduced data exposure in case of misuse

---

## Files Modified

1. `/workspaces/ClosetApp/sql/001_initial_schema.sql`
   - Users table: auth docs, renamed field, soft delete
   - Clothes table: documentation improvements
   - Friends table: bidirectional constraint
   - Suggestions table: length constraints, viewed_at field
   - Likes table: commented out
   - Triggers: added updated_at triggers for all tables

2. `/workspaces/ClosetApp/sql/003_indexes_functions.sql`
   - Added 6 new indexes
   - Improved `check_item_quota()` documentation
   - Fixed `get_friend_closet()` security issues
   - Added `cleanup_old_removed_items()` function

---

## Testing Recommendations

Before proceeding to Batch 2, test these changes:

1. **Auth Integration:** Verify Supabase Auth creates users correctly
2. **Updated_at Triggers:** Test that updates automatically set timestamp
3. **Friends Constraint:** Try creating duplicate friendships (should fail)
4. **Message Length:** Try inserting 101-char message (should fail)
5. **Indexes:** Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on common queries to verify index usage
6. **Cleanup Function:** Test with old soft-deleted items

---

## Next Steps

Ready to proceed with **BATCH 2: RLS POLICY ISSUES** (Issues #11-15)?

This batch will fix critical security issues in Row Level Security policies.
