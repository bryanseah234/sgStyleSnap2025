# Performance Requirements

## 1. Loading Performance Targets

- Initial page load: < 3 seconds
- Route transitions: < 500ms
- Image upload: < 5 seconds (including resize)
- API responses: < 500ms
- Time to Interactive (TTI): < 4 seconds

---

## 2. Optimization Techniques

### 2.1 Code Splitting

```javascript
// Lazy load routes with dynamic imports
const Closet = () => import('../pages/Closet.vue');
const Friends = () => import('../pages/Friends.vue');
const Profile = () => import('../pages/Profile.vue');

// Split vendor bundles
// Separate CSS chunks
```

---

### 2.2 Image Optimization

- Lazy load images below fold
- Use responsive images with srcset
- Preload critical images
- WebP format with JPEG/PNG fallbacks
- Generate multiple thumbnail sizes

---

### 2.3 Caching Strategy

- Cache API responses in Pinia stores
- Use browser cache for static assets
- Implement service worker for offline functionality
- LocalStorage for user preferences
- CDN caching for images

---

### 2.4 Bundle Optimization

- Tree shake unused code
- Minify JS/CSS
- Compress with gzip/brotli
- Remove console.logs in production
- Analyze bundle size regularly

---

## 3. Mobile Performance

### 3.1 Touch Optimization

- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Debounce search inputs (300ms)
- Throttle scroll events (16ms)
- Optimize for 3G/4G networks
- Reduce animations on low-end devices

---

### 3.2 Memory Management

- Virtual scrolling for lists > 100 items
- Clean up event listeners
- Limit DOM nodes in large lists
- Optimize image memory usage
- Garbage collection optimization

---

## 4. API Performance

### 4.1 Database Optimization

- Use indexes for common queries
- Limit result sets with pagination
- Cache frequent queries
- Optimize JOIN operations
- Use database functions for complex logic

---

### 4.2 Network Optimization

- Compress API responses
- Batch multiple requests
- Use HTTP/2 where available
- Implement request deduplication
- Cache API responses appropriately

---

## 5. Monitoring & Metrics

### 5.1 Performance Monitoring

- Core Web Vitals tracking
- API response time monitoring
- Image load performance
- Bundle size tracking
- Memory usage monitoring

---

### 5.2 Performance Budget

- Maximum bundle size: 500KB gzipped
- Maximum image size: 1MB after compression
- Maximum API response time: 500ms
- Maximum time to interactive: 4 seconds

---

## 6. Specific Component Performance

### 6.1 ClosetGrid Performance

- Virtual scrolling for large closets
- Lazy image loading
- Debounced filtering
- Optimized re-renders

---

### 6.2 SuggestionCanvas Performance

- Efficient drag-and-drop library
- Optimized re-renders during drag
- Memory-efficient item storage
- Smooth animations
