# Row Level Security (RLS) Policies Reference

This document provides a comprehensive reference for all Row Level Security (RLS) policies currently implemented in the StyleSnap database.

## üìã Overview

The StyleSnap database implements comprehensive RLS policies across all schemas to ensure data privacy and security. This document provides a flattened, table-by-table reference of all policies.

## üîê Schema Overview

- **auth**: Authentication and user management
- **public**: Application data tables
- **storage**: File storage and management
- **realtime**: Real-time messaging and events

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ RLS enabled  
**Key Columns**: `id`, `name`, `owner_id`, `public`  
**Patterns**: Public bucket read if `bucket.public = true`, owner-only management (`owner_id = auth.uid()`)

### storage.objects

## üõ°Ô∏è Service Role Policies

### service_role policies

| Policy Name | Command | Roles | USING Condition | WITH CHECK |
|-------------|---------|-------|-----------------|------------|
| "service_role_insert" | INSERT | authenticated | `auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role'` | - |
| "service_role_update" | UPDATE | authenticated | `auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role'` | - |

*Used to allow service role scoped behavior*

---

## üîç Policy Analysis

### Common Patterns

1. **Ownership-Based Access**: Most policies use `auth.uid() = user_id` or `auth.uid() = owner_id`
2. **Friendship-Based Access**: Complex policies check for accepted friendships between users
3. **Privacy Levels**: Public, friends, and private visibility controls
4. **Service Role Access**: Special policies for system operations

### Security Features

- **Data Isolation**: Users can only access their own data by default
- **Friend Visibility**: Controlled access to friends' data based on privacy settings
- **Public Content**: Limited public access for catalog items and public outfits
- **System Operations**: Service role policies for administrative functions

## üß™ Testing RLS Policies

### Verify Policy Existence

```sql
-- Check all policies for a specific table
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'users';

-- Check policies by schema
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd, roles
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

### Test Policy Enforcement

```sql
-- Test as authenticated user
SET LOCAL role TO authenticated;
SET LOCAL "request.jwt.claims" TO '{"sub": "user-uuid-here"}';

-- Test policy enforcement
SELECT * FROM users; -- Should only return user's own data
```
