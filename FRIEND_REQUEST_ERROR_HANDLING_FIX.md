# Friend Request Error Handling - Graceful Improvements

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

---

## 🎯 Problem

User attempted to add themselves as a friend, resulting in a raw database RLS (Row-Level Security) error:

```
❌ Error: new row violates row-level security policy for table "friends"
ErrorCode: 42501
Status: 403 Forbidden
```

**User Experience:** Confusing technical error message, poor UX

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **Three Layers of Protection**

#### 1. **Frontend Prevention (UI Layer)** ✅
**File:** `src/pages/Friends.vue`

**What:** Filter out current user from search results

```javascript
// Get current user ID to filter out from results
const currentUser = await userService.getCurrentUser()
const currentUserId = currentUser?.id

// Filter out the current user from search results
const filteredResults = (result || []).filter(user => user.id !== currentUserId)
```

**Impact:** Users won't even see themselves in search results

---

#### 2. **Service Layer Validation** ✅
**File:** `src/services/friendsService.js` (Line 314-318)

**What:** Early validation with friendly error message

```javascript
// Validate: Cannot add yourself as a friend
if (userId === user.id) {
  console.warn('⚠️ FriendsService: User attempting to add themselves as a friend')
  throw new Error('You cannot add yourself as a friend')
}
```

**Impact:** Catches edge cases before database call, provides clear error message

---

#### 3. **Error Code Translation** ✅
**File:** `src/services/friendsService.js` (Line 408-422)

**What:** Translate database error codes to user-friendly messages

```javascript
if (error) {
  console.error('❌ FriendsService: Error inserting friend request:', error)
  
  // Handle specific error cases with user-friendly messages
  if (error.code === '42501') {
    // RLS policy violation
    throw new Error('Unable to send friend request. You cannot add yourself as a friend.')
  } else if (error.code === '23505') {
    // Unique constraint violation - friendship already exists
    throw new Error('Friend request already exists')
  } else {
    // Generic error
    throw new Error(error.message || 'Failed to send friend request')
  }
}
```

**Impact:** Fallback for any RLS or constraint errors, always user-friendly

---

## 📊 Before vs After

### **Before** ❌
```
Console Error:
🤝 FriendsService: Friend request data: 
{
  receiver_id: "8033f3a5-29e1-496c-b6d9-bb61b595d2e8",
  requester_id: "8033f3a5-29e1-496c-b6d9-bb61b595d2e8",
  status: "pending"
}

Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 ()
Error: new row violates row-level security policy for table "friends"
ErrorCode: 42501
```

**User sees:** Technical database error, no idea what went wrong

---

### **After** ✅

#### **Scenario 1: User searches for themselves**
- Current user **filtered out** from search results
- User **doesn't see themselves** in the list
- **No error occurs** at all

#### **Scenario 2: Direct API call (edge case)**
```
Console Warning:
⚠️ FriendsService: User attempting to add themselves as a friend

User sees (friendly toast message):
"You cannot add yourself as a friend"
```

#### **Scenario 3: RLS error slips through (safety net)**
```
User sees (friendly toast message):
"Unable to send friend request. You cannot add yourself as a friend."
```

## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### **Previous Flow:**
1. User searches for their username
2. Sees themselves in results ❌
3. Clicks "Add Friend"
4. Gets cryptic RLS error ❌
5. Confused, tries again ❌

### **New Flow:**
1. User searches for their username
2. **Doesn't see themselves** in results ✅
3. Nothing to click, no error ✅

**OR** (if somehow they bypass the filter):

1. User attempts to add themselves
2. Gets clear message: **"You cannot add yourself as a friend"** ✅
3. Understands immediately ✅

---

## 🛡️ Additional Error Handling Added

### **Unique Constraint Violations**
```javascript
if (error.code === '23505') {
  throw new Error('Friend request already exists')
}
```

**Handles:** Duplicate friend request attempts

---

### **Generic Database Errors**
```javascript
else {
  throw new Error(error.message || 'Failed to send friend request')
}
```

**Handles:** Any other database errors gracefully

---

## 🔍 Technical Details

### **Error Codes Handled:**

| Code | Meaning | User-Friendly Message |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| `42501` | RLS policy violation | "You cannot add yourself as a friend" |
| `23505` | Unique constraint violation | "Friend request already exists" |
| Other | Generic database error | Error message or "Failed to send friend request" |

### **Validation Order:**

1. **UI Filter** - Prevent user from seeing themselves (Lines 595-606 in Friends.vue)
2. **Service Validation** - Early check before database call (Lines 314-318 in friendsService.js)
3. **Error Translation** - Friendly messages for database errors (Lines 408-422 in friendsService.js)

---

## 📁 Files Modified

1. ✅ **`src/services/friendsService.js`**
   - Added self-friend validation
   - Enhanced error code translation
   - Added user-friendly error messages

2. ✅ **`src/pages/Friends.vue`**
   - Filter current user from search results
   - Prevent UI from showing self-add option

---

## 🧪 Test Cases

### **Test Case 1: Search for Self**
- **Action:** User searches for their own username
- **Expected:** User not in search results
- **Result:** ✅ Pass

### **Test Case 2: Direct Service Call (Edge Case)**
- **Action:** `friendsService.sendFriendRequest(currentUserId)`
- **Expected:** Error: "You cannot add yourself as a friend"
- **Result:** ✅ Pass

### **Test Case 3: RLS Error Fallback**
- **Action:** Database RLS blocks request
- **Expected:** User-friendly error message
- **Result:** ✅ Pass

### **Test Case 4: Duplicate Friend Request**
- **Action:** Send same friend request twice
- **Expected:** "Friend request already exists"
- **Result:** ✅ Pass (existing validation + new error handling)

---

## 💡 Additional Improvements

### **Console Logging Enhanced**
```javascript
console.warn('⚠️ FriendsService: User attempting to add themselves as a friend')
console.log('🔧 Friends: Filtered out current user from search results')
```

**Benefits:**
- Easier debugging
- Track edge case attempts
- Monitor user behavior

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

Consider adding similar protection for:
1. Removing yourself as a friend (if that's possible)
2. Blocking yourself
3. Other self-referential actions
