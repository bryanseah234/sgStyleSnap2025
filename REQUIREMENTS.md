### Item Statistics & Details
When viewing an item in the virtual closet, users can see comprehensive statistics:

- **Favorite Status:** Whether item is marked as favorite (with toggle button)
- **Category & Type:** Item's category and specific clothing type
- **Detected Color:** AI-detected color with visual color swatch

### Catalog Privacy
- **Anonymous Browsing:** All catalog items displayed without owner information
- **No Attribution:** Users cannot see who uploaded catalog items (admin or other users)
- **Privacy by Design:** catalog_items table has no owner_id column

### Catalog Auto-Contribution
- **Automatic Addition:** User uploads automatically added to catalog (no prompt)
- **Background Process:** Catalog contribution happens silently after successful upload
- **Smart Filtering:** Catalog browse excludes items user already owns

### Friend Search & Relationships

  - Minimum 3-character query
  - Rate limiting: 20 searches per minute
  - Result limit: 10 users maximum
  - Random ordering (no pagination)
  - Email addresses never exposed
- **Friendship States:**
  - `pending`: Friend request sent, awaiting response
  - `accepted`: Mutual friendship established
  - `rejected`: Friend request declined
- **Relationship Management:** Send requests, accept/reject, unfriend

### Outfit Generation (Permutation-Based)
**Algorithm Type:** Rule-based permutation system (NO machine learning)

**How It Works:**
1. Group user's closet items by category (top, bottom, shoes, outerwear, accessories)
2. Generate permutations with **exactly ONE item per category**
3. Score outfits using color harmony rules and style compatibility
4. Filter by weather, occasion, and user preferences
5. Return top-scoring combinations

**Category Rules (CRITICAL):**
- ‚úÖ Valid: 1 top + 1 bottom + 1 shoes
- ‚ùå Invalid: 2 tops, 2 bottoms, 2 shoes in same outfit
- ‚úÖ Valid: 1 top + 1 bottom + 1 shoes + 1 outerwear + 1 accessory
- ‚ùå Invalid: 1 top + 1 top (even if different styles)
- **Enforcement:** Algorithm validates NO duplicate categories before scoring

**Scoring System (0-100):**
- Color Harmony (40%): Monochromatic, complementary, analogous, neutral
- Completeness (60%): Required items (top+bottom+shoes) + optional (outerwear, accessories)

**Visual Presentation:**
- Outfits displayed as **item images on blank canvas**
- NO superimposition on person/mannequin
- Items arranged vertically or in grid layout
- Order: top ‚Üí bottom ‚Üí shoes ‚Üí outerwear ‚Üí accessories
- Each item shown in original uploaded photo

**User Actions:**
- Generate outfit with weather/occasion parameters
- Rate outfits (1-5 stars) for personal tracking
- Save favorite outfits to collection
- Regenerate to get different permutation
- Swap individual items (respects category rules)

**Manual Outfit Creation:**
- **Create outfits manually** via drag-and-drop interface
- **Drag items** from closet sidebar onto blank canvas
- **Search/filter items** while creating (category, name, color)
- **Position items freely** anywhere on canvas (x, y coordinates)
- **No category restrictions** - Add any combination (2 tops for layering, 3 accessories, etc.)
- **Z-index reordering** - Layer items for visual depth
- **Save with metadata** - Custom name, notes, and tags
- **Edit existing outfits** - Add/remove/reposition items
- **Auto-save drafts** - Work saved automatically
- **Max 10 items per outfit** - Practical limit

**Storage:**
- Manual outfits stored in same table as auto-generated
- Flagged with `is_manual: true`
- Includes `item_positions` (x, y, z_index for each item)
- Includes `outfit_name`, `outfit_notes`, `tags`

**Future Enhancements (NOT implemented yet):**
- Machine learning from user preferences
- Photo overlay on mannequin/person
- Style transfer from inspiration photos
- Collaborative filtering ("Users like you also liked...")
- Canvas item resize/rotate controls
- Outfit templates/layouts

### Social Feed (Friends-Only Outfits)
**Feed Display:**
- Shows outfits shared by **accepted friends only**
- Sorted **chronologically** (newest first)
- Displays username, avatar, outfit image, caption, like/comment counts
- Real-time like/unlike functionality
- Navigate to full outfit details on tap

**Friends-Only Filtering:**
- Uses `friends` table with canonical ordering (requester_id < receiver_id)
- Checks **both directions** of friendship relationship
- Only shows outfits when `status = 'accepted'`
- **Automatically excludes:**
  - Non-friends (no friendship record)
  - Pending requests (status = 'pending')
  - Rejected requests (status = 'rejected')
  - Unfriended users (friendship deleted from database)

**Dynamic Updates:**
- When user unfriends someone ‚Üí Their outfits **immediately disappear** from feed
- When friendship changes to 'rejected' ‚Üí Outfits removed from feed
- When friendship accepted ‚Üí Outfits appear in feed
- No caching of old friendships - queries live data every time

**Bidirectional Query:**
```sql
WHERE user_id IN (
  SELECT CASE 
    WHEN requester_id = current_user THEN receiver_id
    WHEN receiver_id = current_user THEN requester_id
  END
  FROM friends
  WHERE (requester_id = current_user OR receiver_id = current_user)
    AND status = 'accepted'
)
ORDER BY created_at DESC
```

**Empty State:**
- If user has 0 accepted friends ‚Üí Shows "Add friends to see their outfits"
- Friendly message with link to Friends page

**Pagination:**
- Default: 20 outfits per page
- Max: 50 outfits per request
- Infinite scroll or "Load More" button

### Notification System (Friends-Only Interactions)

   - View full outfit with all items
   - Read friend's message (if provided)
   - Options: "Approve" or "Reject" buttons
   - **On Approve:**
