## Issues Fixed

### Issue 64: Outfit History & Analytics

**Problem:**
- Users had no way to track which outfits they actually wore
- No data on which items were used most frequently
- Missing insights into personal style patterns
- No way to remember what worked well for different occasions
- Couldn't identify underutilized items in their closet

**Solution:**
Created comprehensive outfit history tracking and analytics system:

**Database Schema (`sql/004_advanced_features.sql`):**
```sql
-- Track outfit wearing history
CREATE TABLE outfit_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  suggestion_id UUID, -- Link to original suggestion
  outfit_items JSONB NOT NULL, -- Denormalized outfit data
  worn_date DATE NOT NULL,
  occasion VARCHAR(100), -- work, casual, date, party
  weather_temp INTEGER,
  weather_condition VARCHAR(50),
  rating INTEGER CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
  notes TEXT,
  photo_url TEXT -- Optional photo of actual outfit
);
```

**Analytics Functions:**
```sql
-- Get user's outfit statistics
CREATE FUNCTION get_user_outfit_stats(p_user_id UUID)
RETURNS TABLE (
  total_outfits_worn INTEGER,
  avg_rating NUMERIC(3,2),
  most_worn_occasion VARCHAR(100),
  favorite_season VARCHAR(20),
  total_items_used INTEGER,
  most_worn_item_id UUID,
  most_worn_item_count INTEGER
);

-- Get most worn items
CREATE FUNCTION get_most_worn_items(p_user_id UUID, p_limit INTEGER)
RETURNS TABLE (
  cloth_id UUID,
  item_name VARCHAR(255),
  category VARCHAR(50),
  wear_count INTEGER,
  avg_rating NUMERIC(3,2),
  last_worn DATE
);

-- Identify items that haven't been worn
CREATE FUNCTION get_unworn_combinations(p_user_id UUID)
RETURNS TABLE (
  cloth_id UUID,
  item_name VARCHAR(255),
  category VARCHAR(50),
  last_worn_days_ago INTEGER
);
```

**API Endpoints Added:**

- Couldn't share successful outfits publicly
- No way to react to or comment on outfits

**Solution:**
Created full social feed with sharing, likes, comments, and public links:

**Database Schema:**
```sql

CREATE TABLE shared_outfits (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  suggestion_id UUID,
  outfit_items JSONB NOT NULL,
  caption TEXT,
  visibility VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- public, friends, private
  share_token VARCHAR(32) UNIQUE, -- For public links
  likes_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  comments_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  views_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Likes on outfits
CREATE TABLE outfit_likes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  outfit_id UUID NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(outfit_id, user_id) -- One like per user
);

-- Comments on outfits
CREATE TABLE outfit_comments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  outfit_id UUID NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  comment_text TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (LENGTH(comment_text) <= 1000)
);

2. **`GET /api/shared-outfits/feed`** - View social feed
   ```json
   {
     "feed": [
       {
         "id": "uuid",
         "user": {
           "display_name": "Jane Doe",
           "avatar_url": "https://..."
         },
         "caption": "Perfect work outfit!",
         "outfit_items": [...],
         "likes_count": 5,
         "comments_count": 2,

CREATE POLICY "view_friends_outfits"
  ON shared_outfits FOR SELECT
  USING (
    visibility = 'friends' AND
    user_id IN (SELECT friend_id FROM friendships WHERE status = 'accepted')
  );

### Issue 66: Weather Integration

**Problem:**
- Outfit suggestions didn't consider weather conditions
- Users had to manually check weather before getting suggestions
- No temperature-appropriate recommendations
- Missing rain/snow considerations
- Couldn't filter items by weather suitability

**Solution:**
Integrated OpenWeatherMap API with intelligent weather-based filtering:

**Weather Service (`src/services/weather-service.js`):**

```javascript
/**
 * Get current weather for user's location
 */
export async function getCurrentWeather(lat, lon) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `${WEATHER_API_BASE}/weather?lat=${lat}&lon=${lon}&appid=${API_KEY}&units=imperial`
  );
  
  return {
    temp: Math.round(data.main.temp),
    feels_like: Math.round(data.main.feels_like),
    condition: data.weather[0].main.toLowerCase(), // rain, snow, clear
    description: data.weather[0].description,
    humidity: data.main.humidity,
    wind_speed: Math.round(data.wind.speed)
  };
}

/**
 * Categorize temperature for outfit selection
 */
export function categorizeTemperature(temp) {
  if (temp < 40) return 'very_cold';  // Heavy coat
  if (temp < 55) return 'cold';       // Jacket
  if (temp < 65) return 'cool';       // Light jacket
  if (temp < 75) return 'mild';       // No layers
  if (temp < 85) return 'warm';       // Light clothing
  return 'hot';                        // Very light clothing
}

/**
 * Get outfit recommendations based on weather
 */
export function getWeatherBasedRecommendations(temp, condition) {
  const recommendations = {
    layers: 1,
    categories: [],
    waterproof: false,
    notes: []
  };
  
  // Temperature-based
  if (temp < 40) {
    recommendations.layers = 3;
    recommendations.categories = ['outerwear', 'top', 'bottom'];
    recommendations.notes.push('Heavy coat or jacket recommended');
    recommendations.notes.push('Consider warm accessories');
  } else if (temp > 85) {
    recommendations.layers = 1;
    recommendations.categories = ['top', 'bottom'];
    recommendations.notes.push('Lightweight, breathable clothing');
    recommendations.notes.push('Light colors reflect heat');
  }
  
  // Condition-based
  if (condition === 'rain' || condition === 'drizzle') {
    recommendations.waterproof = true;
    recommendations.notes.push('Waterproof jacket or raincoat');
    recommendations.notes.push('Consider waterproof footwear');
  }
  
  return recommendations;
}

/**
 * Filter clothing items based on weather
 */
export function filterItemsByWeather(items, temp, condition) {
  const recommendations = getWeatherBasedRecommendations(temp, condition);
  const tempCategory = categorizeTemperature(temp);
  
  return items.filter(item => {
    // Filter by required categories
    if (!recommendations.categories.includes(item.category)) {
      if (item.category !== 'shoes' && item.category !== 'accessory') {
        return false;
      }
    }
    
    // Filter by style tags
    if (item.style_tags) {
      // Cold weather: exclude summer items
      if (tempCategory === 'very_cold' || tempCategory === 'cold') {
        if (item.style_tags.includes('summer') || item.style_tags.includes('shorts')) {
          return false;
        }
      }
      
      // Hot weather: exclude winter items
      if (tempCategory === 'hot' || tempCategory === 'warm') {
        if (item.style_tags.includes('winter') || item.style_tags.includes('heavy')) {
          return false;
        }
      }
      
      // Boost waterproof items in rain
      if (recommendations.waterproof && item.style_tags.includes('waterproof')) {
        item.weatherScore = 1.5;
      }
    }
    
    return true;
  });
}

/**
 * Generate weather-aware outfit suggestion
 */
export async function getWeatherAwareSuggestion(userId) {
  // Get user's location
  const location = await getUserLocation();
  
  // Get current weather
  const weather = await getCurrentWeather(location.lat, location.lon);
  
  // Get user's items
  const { data: items } = await supabase
    .from('clothes')
    .select('*')
    .eq('owner_id', userId)
    .is('removed_at', null);
  
  // Filter by weather suitability
  const suitableItems = filterItemsByWeather(items, weather.temp, weather.condition);
  
  // Build outfit
  const recommendations = getWeatherBasedRecommendations(weather.temp, weather.condition);
  const outfit = {};
  
  for (const category of recommendations.categories) {
    const categoryItems = suitableItems.filter(i => i.category === category);
    if (categoryItems.length > 0) {
      // Prioritize items with higher weatherScore
      categoryItems.sort((a, b) => (b.weatherScore || 1) - (a.weatherScore || 1));
      outfit[category] = categoryItems[0];
    }
  }
  
  return {
    outfit,
    weather: {
      temp: weather.temp,
      condition: weather.condition,
      tempCategory: categorizeTemperature(weather.temp)
    },
    recommendations: recommendations.notes
  };

### Issue 67: Style Preferences & AI Learning

**Problem:**
- Suggestions didn't learn from user preferences
- No way to specify favorite colors or styles
- Couldn't indicate likes/dislikes on suggestions
- Missing personalization over time
- No style profile to guide recommendations

**Solution:**
Created comprehensive preference system with feedback learning:

**Database Schema:**
```sql
-- User style preferences
CREATE TABLE style_preferences (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  favorite_colors TEXT[], -- ['black', 'navy', 'gray']
  avoid_colors TEXT[],
  preferred_styles TEXT[], -- ['casual', 'business', 'streetwear']
  preferred_brands TEXT[],
  fit_preference VARCHAR(20), -- tight, fitted, regular, loose, oversized
  common_occasions TEXT[], -- ['work', 'casual', 'gym']
  suggestion_feedback JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::JSONB
);

-- Suggestion feedback (thumbs up/down)
CREATE TABLE suggestion_feedback (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  suggestion_id UUID NOT NULL,
  feedback_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- like, dislike, love
  feedback_reason TEXT,
  UNIQUE(user_id, suggestion_id)
);
```

**API Endpoints Added:**

1. **`GET /api/style-preferences`** - Get user's preferences
   ```json

     "preferred_brands": ["Uniqlo", "J.Crew"],
     "fit_preference": "regular",
     "common_occasions": ["work", "casual"]
   }
   ```

2. **`PUT /api/style-preferences`** - Update preferences

   ```json
   {
     "feedback_type": "like",
     "feedback_reason": "Love the color combination"
   }
   ```

4. **`GET /api/suggestions/recommended`** - AI-powered recommendations
   ```json
   {
     "suggestions": [
       {
         "items": [...],
         "confidence_score": 0.85,
         "reason": "Based on your favorite colors and most worn items",
         "occasion": "work"
       }
     ],
     "based_on": {
       "wear_history": true,
       "preferences": true,
       "feedback": true
     }
   }
   ```

**AI Learning Algorithm:**

```javascript
/**
 * Generate personalized suggestions based on:
 * 1. User's style preferences
 * 2. Outfit history (what they actually wear)
 * 3. Feedback on past suggestions (likes/dislikes)
 */
function generatePersonalizedSuggestions(userId) {
  // Get preferences
  const preferences = getStylePreferences(userId);
  
  // Get wear history analytics
  const mostWorn = getMostWornItems(userId);
  const highRatedOutfits = getHighRatedOutfits(userId);
  
  // Get feedback patterns
  const likedSuggestions = getSuggestionFeedback(userId, 'like');
  const dislikedSuggestions = getSuggestionFeedback(userId, 'dislike');
  
  // Score items based on:
  scores = items.map(item => {
    let score = 1.0;
    
    // Boost favorite colors
    if (preferences.favorite_colors.includes(item.color)) {
      score *= 1.5;
    }
    
    // Penalize avoided colors
    if (preferences.avoid_colors.includes(item.color)) {
      score *= 0.3;
    }
    
    // Boost frequently worn items
    if (mostWorn.includes(item.id)) {
      score *= 1.3;
    }
    
    // Boost items from liked suggestions
    if (appearsInLikedSuggestions(item)) {
      score *= 1.4;
    }
    
    // Penalize items from disliked suggestions
    if (appearsInDislikedSuggestions(item)) {
      score *= 0.5;
    }
    
    // Match preferred styles
    if (hasMatchingStyle(item, preferences.preferred_styles)) {
      score *= 1.2;
    }
    
    return { item, score };
  });
  
  // Sort by score and build outfits from top items

  outfits_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Outfits within collections
CREATE TABLE collection_outfits (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  collection_id UUID NOT NULL,
  suggestion_id UUID,

## Technical Implementation

### Database Design

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Denormalized Outfit Data**: Store outfit_items as JSONB in history/shared tables
   - Preserves outfit even if items are deleted
   - Faster queries (no joins needed)
   - Historical accuracy maintained

2. **Automatic Counters**: Triggers maintain likes_count, comments_count, outfits_count
   - Real-time updates
   - No need to count on every query
   - Performance optimization

3. **Row Level Security**: All tables have RLS policies
   - Privacy-first design
   - Friends can view friends-only content
   - Public content accessible to all

4. **Analytics Functions**: PostgreSQL functions for complex queries
   - Efficient aggregations
   - Reusable across endpoints
   - Database-level computation

### API Design

**RESTful Principles:**
- Resource-based URLs (`/api/collections`, `/api/outfit-history`)
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Consistent response formats
- Pagination on list endpoints
- Filter parameters for queries

**Performance Considerations:**
- Database indexes on all foreign keys
- GIN indexes on JSONB columns
- Limit result sets with pagination
- Eager loading of related data
- Caching of weather data (5 minutes)

### Weather Service

**OpenWeatherMap Integration:**
- Free tier: 1000 calls/day
- 5-minute cache for same location
- Geolocation API for user position
- Fallback to manual location entry
- Temperature in Fahrenheit (configurable)

**Smart Filtering:**
- 6 temperature categories
- Weather condition matching
- Style tag analysis
- Waterproof prioritization in rain
- Scoring system for item suitability

### AI Learning

**Feedback Loop:**
1. User provides feedback (like/dislike)
2. System tracks feedback patterns
3. Analyze what was liked/disliked
4. Adjust future suggestions
5. Show confidence scores

**Learning Factors:**
- Explicit preferences (colors, styles)
- Implicit preferences (wear frequency)
- Feedback signals (likes/dislikes)
- Context (occasion, weather)
- Time-based (seasonal patterns)

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests

```javascript
// Weather service tests
describe('Weather Service', () => {
  test('categorizeTemperature', () => {
    expect(categorizeTemperature(35)).toBe('very_cold');
    expect(categorizeTemperature(50)).toBe('cold');
    expect(categorizeTemperature(70)).toBe('mild');
    expect(categorizeTemperature(90)).toBe('hot');
  });
  
  test('filterItemsByWeather - cold weather', () => {
    const items = [
      { category: 'top', style_tags: ['summer', 'light'] },
      { category: 'outerwear', style_tags: ['winter', 'heavy'] }
    ];
    
    const filtered = filterItemsByWeather(items, 30, 'snow');
    expect(filtered).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(filtered[0].category).toBe('outerwear');
  });
});

// Analytics tests
describe('Analytics', () => {
  test('getMostWornItems returns top items', async () => {
    const result = await getMostWornItems(userId, 5);
    expect(result).toHaveLength(5);
    expect(result[0].wear_count).toBeGreaterThan(result[1].wear_count);
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

```javascript
describe('Outfit History API', () => {
  test('POST /api/outfit-history creates record', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/outfit-history')
      .send({
        outfit_items: [{ cloth_id: uuid, name: 'Test' }],
        worn_date: '2025-10-05',
        occasion: 'work',
        rating: 4
      });
    
    expect(response.status).toBe(201);
    expect(response.body.id).toBeDefined();
  });
});

describe('Social Feed API', () => {
  test('GET /api/shared-outfits/feed returns feed', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .get('/api/shared-outfits/feed')
      .query({ limit: 10 });
    
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(response.body.feed).toBeInstanceOf(Array);
  });
});
```
